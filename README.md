## Purpose

I built this project to test my skills creating and controlling html elements through javascript as well as using JSON and local storage to have data persist through page refreshes.

## Functional Description

This application is a coding quiz that tests the user's knowledge of javascript.

Upon clicking the start quiz button, the user has 75 seconds to answer as many questions about javascript as they can. If they answer incorrectly, 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer.

Every correct answer will add 10 points to the user's score. If the user correctly answers all of the questions in the time allotted, the remaining time will be added to their score.

The user can answer each question by clicking on the answer or by pressing the number key that corresponds to each answer.

After completing the quiz, the user will see a screen that will prompt them to enter their initials to store their high scores.
